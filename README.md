This project was done as part of the "Computer Game Development" course at Ariel University.

You can see the assignment at the following link: 
https://github.com/gamedev-at-ariel/gamedev-5781/blob/master/02-unity-basics/homework.pdf

The aim of the project was to get to know the unity environment and practice the language c #.
###  First section:
We built 4 components with different functionality:
1. A component called an Oscillator, which moves a play object in a pendulum motion, for example: right to a certain limit, then left to a certain limit, and so on.
2.  An element called a rotator, which rotates a play object at a given speed around itself.
3.  A spherical component, gradually increasing and gradually decreasing, like a beating heart.
4.  An element that allows the player to hide his bone at the touch of a button, and display it
Re-press a button.

###  Section Two:
1. We had to build a game where the player can move in a two-dimensional world with the arrow keys, and at the same time he sees his location on a small map (mini-map) on the top right.
2. "Game" for two players, each player can move one character, and each player sees the world from the point of view of his character, on a half screen

###  Third section:
In this section we could practice C # from the site https://www.hackerrank.com/ or from the site https://www.codingame.com/training, we chose to practice from the codingame site
Here are the 3 games we practiced:
